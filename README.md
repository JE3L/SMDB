Project Title: SMDB = Small Movie Database

Project Description
-------------------
	In this ever increasing entertainment world, we need a database management system to store and retrive the data.
	We also need to store the data efficiently, this database also needs to be user friendly so that users can retrive the data easily. We will not include TV Shows and Other Media Content (Images, Videos) in our database otherwise it will be a huge database in terms of size.
	The database provides in depth detail of a movie which may be helpful to a user who is looking for a new movie to watch or to review a watched movie.


Scope of the database:
----------------------	
	The database involves keeping record of movies, actors, charators, directors, producers, runtime, reviews, users, Box Office records, movies description, release date, genre, trivia, user watchlist, awards, other movie details.
	Basically our movie database is similar to IMDB(International Movie Database) on a small scale.
	
Questions of users that database can answer:
-------------------------------------------
	movies of a specific actor/director/charator
	reviews of a movie
	movie ranking by user ratings
	movies of a specific genre
	awards received by an actor/movie/director/producer
	movies premiering in the same location in the user lives
	movies released in a specific year or time period
	movies that earned more than a specific amount
	trivia about a movie
	movies that some actors(two or more) worked together in
	cast of a movie
